Since I was testing the Beta RC1 for a month so I expected what to see in the released version. After doing a clean install, I didn't have any problems with Vista recognizing my hardware except for my Epson photo printer which I expected since it wasn't compatitable in the Beta version.\\n\\nI ran into a couple of software compatitabilty issues.\\n\\nSince I have 2 hard drives, I kept XP on the other drive in case I have to play old games.\\n\\nI knew that Vista wasn't that much better than XP function wise but it did offer a different look with the Aero feature which meant I had to upgrade to higher end video card but it was worth it.\\n\\nI was very disappointed when I discovered that the defrag program didn't provide choice in what drive to defrag(I have 8 partitions) or any kind of status bar to view to actually see if the program is running.\\n\\nGet a third party defrag program.\\n\\nSetting up my network was a little tricky since the default workgroup name was changed to Workgroup from MSHOME in XP and I wasn't aware of that.\\n\\nI couldn't setup a new printer on my network XP laptop since it couldn't use the printer driver from my Vista computer. After going to the Vista Community forum, I discovered how to setup a new printer port on both computers.\\n\\nThe Sidebar is a nice feature. The control panel is more in depth\\n\\nOverall I'm disappointed that there wasn't a major change in Vista after 5 years of XP but it does have a lot of bells and whistles.\\n\\nPeople are saying that the $159.00 price tag is overpriced but you get a lot more than the Basic such as the Media Center program and Aero feature.\\n\\nIf you don't need the extras then buy the Basic. At least you have a choice in features.\\n\\nBut I do recommend keeping XP on a separate drive as a backup OS\",\n          \"I have windows vista Home Premium  and I tryed four diferent antivirus from diferent companies and no one works well I have programs conflicts and lot of errors on my Laptop, and then I bought Norton 360 and work Wonderful, this norton really protects your computer and detected malicious internet pages is a good security for my lap and my privacy.\\n\\nI'm happy and my Laptop too now works just like when I boght it 2 mounths a go\\n\\n*** update after a year using Norton 360****\\n\\nI decide to try a diferent antivirus uninstalled it which was not easy because is soo slow, after that my machine start to work faster, after I remove the Norton I couldn't belive who fast my laptop is now.\\n\\nI install the Nod 32 and then the Eset Smart Security 3.0.621.0 both are great. No more crashing, no more slow laptop now I have computer power\\nwith an antivirus that does what its supposed to do, monitor your system, not kill it or slowet So good bye Norton FOREVER , Hello Nod32.\\n\\nTry the free trial and you will love it.\\n\\nI highly highly recommend NOd32\",\n          \"This product removes inportant system settings, files, and information and causes your syetem to crash....it also picks up spyware parasite that only it can see and I found out why....iolo's SM is the parasite!!!

The song slow fade speaks to those who does not just live and walk in faith but also those who are still in the process of finding themselves in the walk of faith and intimate relationship with the Lord, the lyrics simply say \"people never crumble in a day... its a slow fade when you give yourself away...\" this is so true, nobody changes over night and we can start by being careful on what we feed our minds, body, ears, eyes, and soul for our body is the temple of the Lord and we are to keep it holy and live a christ-like life all the time, not just at certain times but 24/7, with or without people around us... we may not get it all right at ones, but its a \"slow fade\" when we make a conscious decision to change our ways and it starts by the choices we make on what to feed our body and soul.\n",

All the way from What This World Needs to Every Man, Slow Fade to all because of Jesus...great just awesome! I had the privilege of seeing this band perform at the Norfolk Scope in Norfolk, VA back last November with my brother and I tell you what..this band cares for souls! I, only being a new christian for a couple of months prior I was on a spirtual high already and this band lifted me up higher! Casting Crowns is one of those exceptional Contemporary Christian Bands that you would feel comfortable having your 6 or 8 year old son or daughter listen to. I had Lifesong and I knew how much I enjoyed that album, still there most phenomenal work to date and then picked up the debut album self titled Casting Crowns. If you want to listen to a band that actually loves Jesus and wants everyone to know it, I can guarantee this band will fulfill your craving.\n"
